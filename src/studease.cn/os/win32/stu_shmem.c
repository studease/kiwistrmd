/*
 * Base addresses selected by system for shared memory mappings are likely
 * to be different on Windows Vista and later versions due to address space
 * layout randomization.  This is however incompatible with storing absolute
 * addresses within the shared memory.
 *
 * To make it possible to store absolute addresses we create mappings
 * at the same address in all processes by starting mappings at predefined
 * addresses.  The addresses were selected somewhat randomly in order to
 * minimize the probability that some other library doing something similar
 * conflicts with us.  The addresses are from the following typically free
 * blocks:
 *
 * - 0x10000000 .. 0x70000000 (about 1.5 GB in total) on 32-bit platforms
 * - 0x000000007fff0000 .. 0x000007f68e8b0000 (about 8 TB) on 64-bit platforms
 *
 * Additionally, we allow to change the mapping address once it was detected
 * to be different from one originally used.  This is needed to support
 * reconfiguration.
